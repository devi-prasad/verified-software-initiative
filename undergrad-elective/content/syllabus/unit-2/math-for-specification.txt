Mathematics for Specification
------------------------------
Programs operate on different types of data - integers, floating point numbers, characters, and boolean data types. These data values can be viewed as being drawn from respective sets - objects which are well-known to mathematicians for centuries. Sets also provide the basis for a theory of functions and relations. These constructions, in turn, allow us to define richer collections such as sequences and bags.
