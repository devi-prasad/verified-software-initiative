The word 'specification' means many things to many people. In program design,
a specification unambiguously states the interfaces between different
components of a program. For the client or the user of an interface, its 
specification provides information required to use the the interface, without 
requiring to know the implementation details. For the implementor of the 
components, it provides precise information required to create a correct 
version, without needing to bother about the actual users.

In program verification, a specification is a formal expression against which 
the program's correctness is proved. Verification is the process of 
demonstrating consistency between a program and its specification.

In program validation, specification may be used to generate test cases for 
black-box testing. It may also be used for unit testing and integration 
testing. 

At another extreme, specification will also serve the purpose of more precise 
program documentation.

Thus, the term program specification may refer to
(1) a statement of requirements for a program
(2) a statement about a design for a program
(3) a formal statement of conditions or properties against which the program
    can be verified.

Here is an example showing a hypothetical (incomplete) specification of multiset data structure.

Multiset
  interface
    new -> MSet
    insert -> MSet -> E -> MSet
    isEmpty -> MSet -> bool
    size -> MSet -> int
    count -> MSet -> E -> int
    delete -> MSet -> E -> MSet
  
  consistency forall ms: MSet. e, e1, e2: E.
    isEmpty(new) = true
    isEmpty(insert(ms, e)) = false
    
    size(new) = 0
    size(insert(ms, e)) = size(ms) + 1

    count(new, e) = 0
    count(insert(ms, e1), e2) = count(ms, e2) + (e1 = e2 ? 1 : 0)

    delete(new, e1) = new
    delete(insert(ms, e1), e2) = (e1 = e2 ? ms : insert(delete(ms, e2), e1))


Preconditions
--------------
Sequential programs define a function from inputs to outputs. The preconditions
specify constraints on various aspects of the data. Such constraints may 
restrict domains and ranges, specify bounds on the size of inputs, and 
the structure of the input. Precondition is also called an input assertion.

More formally, precondition is a predicate which characterizes the initial 
states for the specified computation is well-defined. We will denote a 
precondition by the letter Q. We shall use subscripts for readability.

Some of the different kinds of preconditions that we specify include the following.
    Problem size
    -------------
    size of the array; size of the indices. We generally specify the lower bound and the upper bound.

    Bounds for variables
    ---------------------
    domain and ranges of inputs.

    Properties and assumptions about inputs
    -----------------------------------------
    For example, for binary search to work, the input must be already sorted.
    For heap-sort, the heap property must be maintained.
