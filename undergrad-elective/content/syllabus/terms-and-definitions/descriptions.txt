Specification - rigorously specify what properties a program ought to have.
Specifications may be supplied inline by annotating existing code. 
Specifications may also be supplied in isolation - separately from the code.

Verification Conditions
When a tool is not able to automatically check the assertions supplied by the 
programmer , it emits verification conditions, which are logical assertions 
that must be checked. These verification conditions may be passed to a 
decision procedure or an automated theorem prover. In extreme conditions 
where verification conditions cannot be automatically solved, one may resort 
to interactive theorem proving.
